I. About

This is an adaptation of EV Nova (EVN) - a 2002 space trader/combat game - as a sci-fi 4X strategy game.

Humanity spent several centuries exploring and colonizing the stars, but a cataclysmic terrorist attack destroyed the
hypergate infrastructure that humanity used to travel between planets. Several centuries of isolation followed before
factions regained hyperspace technology. This scenario takes place during the early period of re-expansion and contact.

(If you are familiar with the storyline and 'preamble' of the Nova universe, this scenario is set in approximately
900 NC, about 300 years before the events of EV Nova.)

=======================================================================================================================
II. Credits

Unit sprites and some other assets are from EV Nova, created by ATMOS, Ambrosia, and Matt Burch.

This scenario is created by Logan Hood.

=======================================================================================================================
III. Factions

Each faction has a unique "tech tree" and set of units. For your first playthrough, I recommend the Federation
or the Aurorans. On later playthroughs, try the Polaris, Rebels, or the Association of Free Traders. Wraith/Krypt are
alien factions not intended for human play.

The Federation traces its roots back to the origin of humanity and is based on Earth in the Sol System. The Federation
is well-balanced overall, but - being in the center of known space - may find themselves running into multiple
neighbors.

The Aurorans, to the galactic south, are an expanding empire with a society that places high value on honor (i.e. war).
Their units are cheaper to produce than their counterparts.

The Polaris, who have developed advanced biotechnology, can develop very powerful units but take some time to scale.
Playing as the Polaris requires careful defense and a strong science economy. Their end-game carrier, the Raven, is the
strongest offensive unit in the game.

The Rebellion, an offshoot of the Federation, have a small starting territory, but can develop their technology quickly
and field strong offensive units.

The Association of Free Traders are a pseudo-pirate government. Their units are mobile and attack-oriented. Strike your
neighbors fast! (For players of EV Nova: I've taken some literary-license and blurred the lines between the Associated
Guild and the Association.)

=======================================================================================================================
IV. Gameplay hints (but not spoilers!)

Cities:

* The Pegasus freighter is your Settler unit. Or, if you play as the Polaris, the Sprite is equivalent to Engineers.
* Most of the map is open space and does not have useful resource yield. Build your cities near planets and stars.
* The only terrain improvement you can build are Hyperspace lanes (Roads).
* Production city improvements (Factory, etc.) are cheaper and available earlier in the tech tree. (Pollution is
  disabled, so don't worry about that!)
* Leviathan/Cambrian are equivalent of Caravan/Freight for trading.

Combat:

* Compared to a normal game of civ2, the military units in this scenario tend to be offense-sided. With some factions,
  in the early game you will have to play quite a bit of "active defense" and patrol and stop enemies at the edge of
  your territory, at least until you get City Walls up!
* All of your military units are unlocked by your faction's unique techs. Prioritize these when planning your research
  progression.
* The Nebula terrain is equivalent to Mountains, requiring extra movement to traverse and providing a defense bonus.
  No other terrain (including asteroids) requires movement or has a defense bonus.
* There is no "ocean", and no Air/Sea units; all units are land units.
* To move your ships to the frontlines more quickly, build Hypergates (Airports) in your city and airlift units.

V. Current State and Roadmap

This is an alpha release. It is playable - and hopefully fun! - but some parts are incomplete.

UNITS:
* The set of units in the game are complete; I don't plan to add any additional units.
* The unit sprites are mostly naively downscaled from EV Nova's shipyard graphics. Some need more touch-up to look
  better downscaled and with civ2's color palette.

CITY IMPROVEMENTS / WONDERS:
* Almost all city improvements and wonders are still vanilla civ2 improvements. These need to be replaced with
  thematically appropriate names and graphics, e.g. Outfitter instead of Barracks, Galaxy Racing Network instead of
  Oracle...

TECH ADVANCES:
* Faction-specific tech trees are complete, pending further balance changes.
* Common technology is mostly vanilla and should be replaced with thematically appropriate names.
* The tech tree should probably be "pruned" further, pending further playtesting.

OTHER GRAPHICS:
* City icons are vanilla. (Industrial-era cities floating in space!)
* Terrain is primarily placeholder graphics from the "Master of Orion" scenario from Civ2 MGE. Consider replacing with
  civ2 assets, especially planets.
* Fortification graphics (shield bubbles?)
* Use one of the promotional EVN renders for title art!

MISCELLANEOUS:
* More city (planet) names
* Update LABELS.TXT as necessary to reflect theme and gameplay
* Set starting year to align with EVN preamble timeline/lore.

GAMEPLAY:
* Continue to refine balance and pacing from playtesting.
* Consider introducing terrain improvements (mines on planets, listening stations instead of forts, etc.)
* Consider per-faction win conditions (for example, the Rebellion wins by conquering the Federation capital).

SOUND:
* haven't touched anything yet, still uses civ2 sounds.


This is the general roadmap toward v1.0 release and "completion" of the scenario. Updates will include incremental
balance updates and bugfixes too.

* v0.3 - you are here! - initial alpha release to the CivFanatics community.
* v0.4 - all city improvements, wonders, and tech advances renamed to be thematically-relevant, with placeholder
  or final graphics.
* v0.5 - terrain, city icons, and other graphics are replaced.
* v0.6 - remaining gameplay fixes
* v0.8 - first "beta" release that is content-complete. Share with EV Nova community.
* v1.0 - "final" release.

Z. Spoilers!








How do I unlock the telepath tech tree to get Vell-os ships (Dart/Javelin)?

- If you win combat against a Krypt Pod, that will trigger an event that unlocks the Telepath Awareness technology. The
  Krypt are the teal civilization in the far west of the map.


How do I unlock the Thunderforge?

- You need the Auroran tech "Planetary Shipyards", and trigger the Krypt event as described above.


How do I unlock the Zephyr?

- The Zephyr is a unique Polaris gunship that "tunnel" (paradropping) to hyperjump a very large distance to attack
  behind enemy lines. You need the Polaris tech "Etheric Wake Engine", and win combat against the Wraith to unlock the
  Wraith Biology tech. The Wraith are the orange civilization in the north of the map.


What is the purpose of the 'Kont' planet/terrain?

- It is a 'shortcut' to unlocking Apollo Program - look for a special ringed planet (Kont) in the bottom right of the
  map to trigger a special event.


How do I unlock "The Creature That Lives In Deep Space"?
