I. About

This is an adaptation of EV Nova (EVN) - a 2002 space trader/combat game - as a sci-fi 4X strategy game.

Humanity spent several centuries exploring and colonizing the stars, but a cataclysmic terrorist attack destroyed the
hypergate infrastructure that humanity used to travel between planets. Several centuries of isolation followed before
factions regained hyperspace technology. This scenario takes place during the early period of re-expansion and contact.

(If you are familiar with the storyline and 'preamble' of the Nova universe, this scenario is set in approximately
900 NC, about 300 years before the events of EV Nova.)

=======================================================================================================================
II. Credits and Acknowledgements

This scenario is created by Logan Hood.

The overall concept, as well as unit sprites and some other assets, are based on assets and content from EV Nova,
created by ATMOS, Ambrosia, and Matt Burch.

=======================================================================================================================
III. Factions

Each faction has a unique tech tree and set of units. For your first playthrough, I recommend the Federation,
Aurorans. For more challenge, try the Polaris, Rebels, or the Association of Free Traders. Wraith & Krypt are
alien factions not intended for human play.

The Federation traces its roots back to the origin of humanity and is based on Earth in the Sol System. The Federation
is well-balanced overall, but - being in the center of known space - may find themselves running into multiple
neighbors.

The Aurorans, to the galactic south, are an expanding empire with a society that places high value on honor (i.e. war).
Their units are cheaper to produce than their counterparts.

The Polaris, who have developed advanced biotechnology, can develop very powerful units but take some time to scale.
Playing as the Polaris requires careful defense and a strong science economy. Their end-game carrier, the Raven, is the
strongest offensive unit in the game.

The Rebellion, an offshoot of the Federation, have a small starting territory, but can develop their technology quickly
and field strong offensive units.

The Association of Free Traders are a pseudo-pirate government. Their units are mobile and attack-oriented. Strike your
neighbors fast! (For players of EV Nova: I've taken some literary-license and blurred the lines between the Associated
Guild and the Association.)

=======================================================================================================================
IV. Gameplay hints (but not spoilers!)

Cities:

* The Pegasus freighter is your Settler unit. Or, if you play as the Polaris, the Sprite is equivalent to Engineers.
* Make sure to settle cities near planets! Most of the map is open space and does not have useful resource yield.
  Nebula provides some production and trade, but no food.
* The only terrain improvement you can build are Hyperspace lanes (Roads). Hyperspace lanes provide +1 trade on
  stars, green planets, and rocky planets.
* Production city improvements (Shipyard = Factory) are cheaper and available earlier in the tech tree. (Pollution is
  disabled, so don't worry about that!)
* Leviathan/Cambrian are equivalent of Caravan/Freight for trading.

Combat:

* Apart from a few common units, most combat units are faction-specific. Aurorans can build units starting with "A",
  Federation "F", Association "Pir", Polaris "Pol", and Rebellion "R".
* All factions can build the Starbridge at the beginning of the game, along with one of your unique units.
* Compared to a normal game of civ2, the early-game in this scenario is very offense-sided. With some factions,
  in the early game you will have to play quite a bit of "active defense" and patrol and stop enemies at the edge of
  your territory. Planetary Defense, equivalent of City Walls, is pre-built in a few key cities, but is available
  as a buildable city improvement until late-game.
* The endgame carrier units - Auroran/Federation/Pirate Carrier, Polaris Raven, Rebel IDA Frigate - are very strong
  attack units and bypass the Planetary Defense (City Walls) bonus, but they're "glass cannons" and need
  destroyer/cruiser escorts.
* The Nebula terrain is equivalent to Mountains, requiring extra movement to traverse and providing a defense bonus.
  No other terrain (including asteroids) requires extra movement or has a defense bonus.
* There is no "ocean" and no Air/Sea units; all units are land units.
* To move your ships to the frontlines more quickly, build Hypergates (Airports) in your city and use the airlift
  command.

Governments:

* Despotism is your starting government.
* Astrofeudalism = Monarchy
* Hypercapitalism = The Republic
* AI Governance = Communism
* Augmented Technocracy = Democracy

V. Units

=== Starters ===

Each civilization can build the Starbridge, which is a well-rounded combat ship (2a/2d, 3 moves) and one
faction-specific combat ship:

Faction     | Unit Name           | Description
------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------
Aurorans    | A. Argosy           | Cheap and tanky (2HP). Slow defensive unit
Federation  | F. Anaconda         | Fast defensive fighter
Polaris     | Pol Manta           | Fast offensive fighter
Rebels      | R. Starbridge       | Glass cannon
Association | Pir Starbridge      | Glass cannon
------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------

=== Early Game ===

The Polaris are at a notable disadvantage in the early game; the Striker is deeper down the tech tree. The other
factions get a decent upgrade from researching Fleet Tactics. The Aurorans and Association also unlock complementary
defensive units by researching Astrofeudalism.

Faction     | Unit Name        | Tech            | Description
------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
Aurorans    | A. Abomination   | Fleet Tactics   | Glass cannon
Federation  | F. Patrol Boat   | Fleet Tactics   | Well-balanced, tankier upgrade to the Starbridge (+1 HP)
Rebels      | R. Valkyrie      | Fleet Tactics   | Powerful early-game gunship, good on offense or defense
Association | Pir Valkyrie     | Fleet Tactics   | Fast and powerful; can dominate early-game
Aurorans    | A. Enterprise    | Astrofeudalism  | Slow and tanky, even tougher than the Argosy
Association | Pir Enterprise   | Astrofeudalism  | Tank; faster pirate variant of Auroran enterprise
Polaris     | Pol Striker      | Technophilosoph.| Well-balanced early-game gunship
ALL         | Dart             | Telepath Indoct.| Very fast scout unit, unlocked with special event
------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------

=== Mid-game ===

Unit roles start diverging more drastically in the mid-game. The Polaris do not get any strong defensive unit
in the mid-game, so have to rely on fast attack units at their border. And notably the Rebels unlock the last
of their military units - the IDA Frigate. For the Rebels, it's now or never!

Faction     | Unit Name        | Tech            | Description
------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
Rebels      | R. Dragon        | Deep Space Rsrch| Fast offensive unit, good for hunting down other ships
Polaris     | Pol Dragon       | Deep Space Rsrch| Fast offensive unit, good for hunting down other ships
Aurorans    | A. Cruiser       | Capital Ships   | Tough defensive unit
Federation  | F. Destroyer     | Capital Ships   | Tough defensive unit
Rebels      | R. Destroyer     | Capital Ships   | Tough defensive unit
Association | Pir Manticore    | Capital Ships   | Tough tanky unit (effective attacking or defending)
Polaris     | Pol Arachnid     | Capital Ships   | Fast glass cannon
Rebels      | IDA Frigate      | Cryptoeconomics | Slow glass cannon (Carrier: Ignores city walls!)
ALL         | Javelin          | Telepath Enslav.| Very fast glass cannon, unlocked with special event
ALL         | Zephyr           | Tunneling Organ | Paradropping glass cannon, unlocked with special event
------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------

=== Late game ===

Every faction (other than the Rebels) unlocks a Carrier, strong offensive units that can bypass Planetary
Defense. The Polaris, if allowed to grow into the late game unimpeded, will likely dominate thanks to the
Scarab and the Raven.

Faction     | Unit Name        | Tech            | Description
------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
Polaris     | Pol Scarab       | Metastructural. | Very tough defensive unit
Aurorans    | A. Thunderforge  | Antimatter Cont.| Fast glass cannon, good for hunting down other ships
Federation  | F. RAGE Gunboat  | Autonomous Sci. | Fast glass cannon, good for hunting down other ships
Aurorans    | A. Carrier       | Carriers        | Slow glass cannon (Carrier: Ignores city walls!)
Federation  | F. Carrier       | Carriers        | Slow glass cannon (Carrier: Ignores city walls!)
Association | Pir Carrier      | Carriers        | Slow glass cannon (Carrier: Ignores city walls!)
Polaris     | Pol Raven        | Quantalineariz. | Slow glass cannon (Carrier: Ignores city walls!)
------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------

V. Current State and Roadmap

This is an alpha release. It is playable - and hopefully fun! - but some parts are incomplete.

UNITS:
* The set of units in the game are complete; I don't plan to add any additional units.
* The unit sprites have been improved quite a bit in v0.5. I may still do touch-ups but they're mostly complete.

CITY IMPROVEMENTS / WONDERS:
* Art is mostly finalized with a few rough placeholders, and may need some touch-ups.

TECH ADVANCES:
* Currently the tech tree is organized with faction-specific tech trees as well as a 'general' tree. Unfortunately
  the AI trades tech and goes "wide" across all the trees instead of "deep" in their own tree. Prior to the beta
  release, I'm planning a tech-tree rework to use a single tech tree, with "Not [Faction]" techs to force unique units.

OTHER GRAPHICS:
* Terrain primarily uses assets taken from the "Master of Orion" scenario from Civ2 MGE.
* Uses vanilla fortification graphics (replace with shield bubbles?)
* Uses vanilla people graphics in the cities

GAMEPLAY:
* Continue to refine balance and pacing from playtesting, especially AI interactions and diplomacy.
* Consider per-faction win conditions (for example, the Rebellion wins by conquering the Federation capital).

SOUND:
* haven't touched anything yet, still uses civ2 sounds.

MISCELLANEOUS:
* Need to update LABELS.TXT as necessary to reflect theme and gameplay
* Set starting year to align with EVN preamble timeline/lore.


This is the general roadmap toward v1.0 release and "completion" of the scenario. Updates will include incremental
balance updates and bugfixes too.

Previous major releases:
* v0.3 - initial alpha release to the CivFanatics community.
* v0.4 - all city improvements, wonders, and tech advances renamed to be thematically-relevant, with placeholder
  or final graphics.
* v0.4.1 - city icons and road graphics are replaced, some flavor text updated.

You are here:
* v0.5 - much better-looking unit sprites.

Future releases:
* v0.8 - first "beta" release that is content-complete.
* v1.0 - "final" release.

Z. Spoilers!








How do I unlock the telepath tech tree to get Vell-os ships (Dart/Javelin)?

- If you win combat against a Krypt Pod, that will trigger an event that unlocks the Telepath Awareness technology. The
  Krypt are the teal civilization in the far west of the map.


How do I unlock the Zephyr?

- The Zephyr is a special gunship that can "tunnel" (paradropping) to hyperjump a very large distance to attack
  behind enemy lines. You need to research Hypergates, and win combat against the Wraith to unlock the
  Wraith Biology tech. The Wraith are the orange civilization in the north of the map. (Unlike in canonical EV Nova,
  where the Zephyr is a Polaris-unique ship, any of the factions can build the Zephyr in this mod.)


What is the purpose of the 'Kont' planet/terrain?

- Discovering Kont is a 'shortcut' to unlocking the Those Who Came Before advance, which enables the Ancient Hypergate
  and Kont Expedition wonders (equivalent of Apollo Program and Darwin's Voyage). Look for the ringed planet (Kont)
  in the bottom right of the map to trigger a special event.


How do I unlock "The Creature That Lives In Deep Space"?
