@SCENARIO
@width=500
@title=%STRING0
^^Length: %STRING1 to %STRING2
^
^After the cataclysmic destruction of the hypergate system, humanity was abruptly
^isolated in different parts of the galaxy. Now, centuries later, pockets of human
^settlements have developed new hyperspace-capable spaceships.
^
^Three major factions have formed: the Federation, the Aurorans, and the Polaris.
^Reunification is inevitable... but will it happen peacefully?
^
^^FACTIONS
^Recommended: Polaris (easiest), Federation, Aurorans
^Challenging: Rebellion, Association of Free Traders
^Not for human play: Wraith, Krypt
^
^Each faction has a special tech tree and units.
^The Polaris have stronger ships, but their technology can be stolen!
^
^^OBJECT
^You can win by military victory (conquer the galaxy) or by scientific victory
^(build an inter-galactic spaceship).
^HINT: On either victory path, exploring the far reaches of the galaxy will help!
^
^^THANKS FOR ALPHA TESTING!
^You are playing Alpha v0.3 of this scenario (built approx 3 May 2025).
^It is playable - and hopefully fun! - but some parts are incomplete.
^Please report balance issues and bugs!
