# At a high-level

The scenario is an adaptation of the 2002 space-trading game EV Nova.

In terms of EV Nova canon, it takes place during the reunification of humanity in 900 NC.

# Factions

## Primary factions

* Polaris
* Federation
* Aurorans

There are three "primary" factions. The Polaris are the easiest (due to tech advantages)
but it should be very possible to win as Federation or Aurorans.
These factions have the usual civ scenario objectives; either military domination or scientific victory

## Secondary factions

* Rebels
* Association of Free Traders

These are smaller factions that are much more challenging to play.

The goal of either group is to try to take over Sol (Federation's capital)
and overthrow the corrupt "bureau of internal investigation". Both factions
have some a slight tech advantage over the federation, but have much more
constrained territory.

## Not intended for play

* Wraith
* Krypt

# Balance/Flavor

* Auroran units are cheaper than their counterparts. And if they can manage to unlock it, the Thunderforge is very powerful.
* Rebels advance quickly and are attack-oriented. Have favorable diplomatic relations with the Polaris and the Aurorans.
* Pirate units are mobile and attack-oriented
* Polaris units are expensive but powerful (Their end-game carrier, the Raven, has the strongest Attack rating in the game)
* Vell-os ships are fast (have alpine bonus; the dart moves 9 spaces per turn!)
* Federation is well-balanced overall

In some cases there are units in each "tier" that are objectively better than others. For example, the rebel valkyrie and
pirate valkyrie have all the same stats/cost except pirate valkyrie has 1 extra movement. This is intentional!

# Starting configuration

The primary factions each start with a handful of cities, a small fleet of ships, and some settlers.

## Federation
5 Cities: Sol, Kania, Tichel, Kerella, Nesre Primus

## Polaris
3 Cities: Kel'ariy, Nil'pesetra, Mu'hari

## Aurorans
5 Cities: Aurora, Heraan, Moash, Vella, Dani, Tekel

## Rebels
2 Cities: Koria, Evlei

## Association of Free Traders
1 City: Scheall

## Wraith
2 Cities: Hel'A'Forius, Hot'A'Tanius

## Krypt
2 Cities: Korell, Vellos

# Terrain and Map Design

See https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/b/b3/EVN_Galactic_map.png/revision/latest?cb=20230716151635

The map is "outer space". Ocean is unused; the whole map is 'land' from the perspective of the engine.

The map is composed of scattered star systems.
Every system includes a star and at least one planet.

## Governments

Similar scheme to vanilla; Monarchy and Republic are available fairly early.
Communism and Democracy can be researched later.
Fundamentalism is not available
Make sure to remove Statue of Liberty from play

## Terrain

Unless otherwise noted
* all terrain has no movement penalty and provides no defense bonus.
* terrain can't be improved

Special resources are effectively removed from the game, provide no bonus and have no graphics,
just show up as duplicates in the civilipedia.

# Pirates (Barbarians)

Dev reference: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php/The_Barbarian_Paper

I am making the following design decisions:

* barbarian activity will be set to Restless Tribes
* i will make sure some civ starts out with three of the four of the barbarian-relevant techs
  (mobile warfare, industrialization, gunpowder - NOT guerilla warfare). From my read of the
  barbarian paper, this means only the "mobile warfare" barbarian groups will spawn; i.e.
  riflemen and artillery slots. For the purpose of frequently spawning pirates, these are:

Riflemen -> Pirate Starbridge
Artillery -> Pirate Valkyrie

(Other pirate type units will still spawn in trigger events AND can be created by the guild of fr traders)

# Tech Tree

## "event techs"

There are three "event" technologies that can be unlocked as a reward for exploring deep space:

* "Wraith Biology" in Wraith space (north corner of space)
* "Telepathic Awareness" in Krypt space (northwest corner of space)
* "Those Who Came Before" from exploring Kont

The Wraith/Telepathic techs unlock some special tech trees for other civs.

Interstellar Biology and TWCB are both necessary prerequisites to a Science victory.

## Standard tech tree

All non-alien civs start with:

Writing
Map Making
Trade
Monarchy
The Republic
Warrior Code (Starbridge)
Industrialization

### Economic Tree

Pottery
Currency
Seafaring
Medicine
Banking
Economics
The Corporation
Automobile
Sanitation

### Social Tree

Ceremonial Burial
Code Of laws
Mysticism
Philosophy
Monotheism
Theology
Democracy (make sure to remove Statue of Liberty)
Communism

### Science Tree

Writing
Mathematics
University
Astronomy
Theory of Gravity
Computers
Genetic Engineering

### Energy/Production Tree

Engineering
Invention
Refining
Electronics
Robotics
Mass Production
Recycling
Nuclear Power
Environmentalism

### Future Technology

is unlocked by Genetic Engineering and Environmentalism

### Scientific Victory tree

Apollo Program is unlocked by TWCB tech which is
triggered by the Kont scenario event.

Space Flight (unlocked by Robotics + Computers)
Plastics
Superconductor
Fusion Power


## Faction-aligned techs

There are five "special" mini-tech trees. Each playable tribe starts with the 'root' of one or more of these trees.
While certain civs start out with technologies that the other civs don't have, the ability to steal technologies by conquest is a feature, not a bug.

* Pirate tech (Assoc)
* Rebel tech
* Federation tech
* Auroran tech
* Polaris tech


The Polaris tech tree is significantly stronger than the other civs.

The Rebels, Federation, and Aurorans all have the ability to "naturally" research Pirate tech, but the Assoc gets a head start

(If only one prereq is specified, asusme the previous tech in the table is the prereq.)
("RR" is the "twice removed" tech to prevent techs from being researchable, but keep them in the civilipedia)

### Pirate tech tree

Pirate Tech Tree has tie-ins mostly to the economic tree, so a civ doing a "pirate build" would emphasize economic technologies.

## Special techs

Ref: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php?title=Advanced_Tech%27_Tree_Design_-_Part_Two

Governments?
* Communism           - keep
* Democracy           - keep
* Fundamentalism      - REMOVE!
* Monarchy            - all civs start with it
* The Republic        - all civs start with it

Are modern city graphics going to be a thing?
* Automobile          - avoid? (need to plan city graphics)
* Electronics         - avoid? (need to plan city graphics)

Have other weird side effects i want to avoid:
* Guerilla Warfare    - REMOVE!
* Gunpowder           - REMOVE!

Keep these in the tech tree and make them close to their standard usage:
* Philosophy          - free tech
* Monotheism          - normal cathedral effect?
* Mysticism           - normal temple effect?
* Ceremonial burial   - normal temple effect?
* Theology            - cathedral bonus
* Fusion Power        - nuclear plants don't blow up

All civs should start with these:
* Trade               - allows to see trade goods
* Map Making          - allows map trading

Probably remove these to avoid the tooltips that pop up:
* Bridge Building     - avoid

Need to give these to some civ for barbarians:
* Industrialization   - Need to give to some civ for barbarians (also transforms cities)
* Mobile Warfare      - Need to give to some civ for barbarians

Remove these as improvements are not a thing:
* Construction        - REMOVE! (no plan for fortresses)
* Radio               - REMOVE! (no airbases)
* Railroad            - REMOVE! (no railroads)
* Refrigeration       - REMOVE!

The side effects of these are irrelevant (no ships in the game)
* Nuclear Power
* Navigation
* Seafaring

Finally:
* Invention           - doesn't matter, no goodie huts

# City Improvements

(NOTE: to remove city improvements/wonders, i am assigning them
to 'plu' (PLU) which remains orphaned from the tech tree)
