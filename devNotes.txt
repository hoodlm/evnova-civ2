# At a high-level

The scenario is an adaptation of the 2002 space-trading game EV Nova.

In terms of EV Nova canon, it takes place during the reunification of humanity in 900 NC.

# Factions

## Primary factions

* Polaris
* Federation
* Aurorans

There are three "primary" factions. The Polaris are the easiest (due to tech advantages)
but it should be very possible to win as Federation or Aurorans.
These factions have the usual civ scenario objectives; either military domination or scientific victory

## Secondary factions

* Rebels
* Association of Free Traders

These are smaller factions that are much more challenging to play.

The goal of either group is to try to take over Sol (Federation's capital)
and overthrow the corrupt "bureau of internal investigation". Both factions
have some a slight tech advantage over the federation, but have much more
constrained territory.

## Not intended for play

* Wraith
* Krypt

# Starting configuration

The primary factions each start with a handful of cities, a small fleet of ships, and some settlers.

## Federation
5 Cities: Sol, Kania, Tichel, Kerella, Nesre Primus

## Polaris
3 Cities: Kel'ariy, Nil'pesetra, Mu'hari

## Aurorans
5 Cities: Aurora, Heraan, Moash, Vella, Dani, Tekel

## Rebels
2 Cities: Koria, Evlei

## Association of Free Traders
1 City: Scheall

## Wraith
2 Cities: Hel'A'Forius, Hot'A'Tanius

## Krypt
2 Cities: Korell, Vellos

# Terrain and Map Design

See https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/evn/images/b/b3/EVN_Galactic_map.png/revision/latest?cb=20230716151635

The map is "outer space". Ocean is unused; the whole map is 'land' from the perspective of the engine.

The map is composed of scattered star systems.
Every system includes a star and at least one planet.

## Governments

Polaris: Republic
Wraith/Krypt: Despotism
Others: Monarchy

Communism and Democracy can be researched
Fundamentalism is not available
Make sure to remove Statue of Liberty from play

## Terrain

Unless otherwise noted
* all terrain has no movement penalty and provides no defense bonus.
* terrain can't be improved

Special resources are effectively removed from the game, provide no bonus and have no graphics,
just show up as duplicates in the civilipedia.

Can use hills/jungle/tundra for kont or other special map features? wormholes?

# Pirates (Barbarians)

Dev reference: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php/The_Barbarian_Paper

I am making the following design decisions:

* barbarian activity will be set to Restless Tribes
* i will make sure some civ starts out with three of the four of the barbarian-relevant techs
  (mobile warfare, industrialization, gunpowder - NOT guerilla warfare). From my read of the
  barbarian paper, this means only the "mobile warfare" barbarian groups will spawn; i.e.
  riflemen and artillery slots. For the purpose of frequently spawning pirates, these are:

Riflemen -> Pirate Starbridge
Artillery -> Pirate Valkyrie

It seems like Guerillas and Fanatics _can_ still sometimes spawn. May need to put a duplicate
of Pir Starbridge/Valkyrie in those slots too.

(Other pirate type units will still spawn in trigger events AND can be created by the guild of fr traders)

# Tech Tree

## "event techs"

There are four "event" technologies that can be unlocked as a reward for exploring deep space:

* "Wraith Biology" in Wraith space (north corner of space)
* "Telepathic Awareness" in Krypt space (northwest corner of space)
* "Interstellar Biology" from discovering The Creature That Lives In Deep Space
* "Those Who Came Before" from exploring Kont

The Wraith/Telepathic techs unlock some special tech trees for other civs.

Interstellar Biology and TWCB are both necessary prerequisites to a Science victory.

## Standard tech tree

All non-alien civs start with:

Writing
Map Making
Trade
Monarchy
The Republic
Warrior Code (Starbridge)
Industrialization
Mobile Warfare

### Economic Tree

### Future Technology

### Scientific Victory tree

Space Flight
Plastics
Superconductor
Fusion Power


## Faction-aligned techs

There are five "special" mini-tech trees. Each playable tribe starts with the 'root' of one or more of these trees.
While certain civs start out with technologies that the other civs don't have, the ability to steal technologies by conquest is a feature, not a bug.

* Pirate tech (Assoc)
* Rebel tech
* Federation tech
* Auroran tech
* Polaris tech

The Polaris tech tree is significantly stronger than the other civs.

The Rebels, Federation, and Aurorans all have the ability to "naturally" research Pirate tech, but the Assoc gets a head start.

### Pirate tech tree (7)

Privateering
Organized Crime
Illicit Ship Mods (Pirate Valkyrie)
Aftermarket Engines (Pirate Starbridge)
Weapons Smuggling (Pirate Enterprise)
Advanced Embezzlement (Manticore)

Nil'kemorya (Striker)
Etheric Wake (Dragon)
Capacitor Pulse Laser
Fusion Generators (Arachnid)
POlaron Torpedos (Scarab)
Etheric Induction (Raven)


The Polaris have a bonus tech Tunneling Organ that unlocks the Zephyr (paratrooper).
Its prerequisites are Etheric Wake + "Wraith Biology"


### Rebel Tech Tree (6)

Rebel Tech
Rebel Ship Mods (Rebel Valkyrie)
Rebel Engine Mods (Rebel Starbridge)
Industrial Espionage (Rebel IDA Frigate)
Federation Defecters (Rebel Destroyer)

### Auroran Tech Tree (5+2)

Auroran Shipbuilding (Argosy)
Fusion Pulse Cannons (Abomination)
Freighter Militia (Enterprise)

## Special techs

Ref: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php?title=Advanced_Tech%27_Tree_Design_-_Part_Two

Governments?
* Communism           - keep
* Democracy           - keep
* Fundamentalism      - REMOVE!
* Monarchy            - all civs start with it
* The Republic        - all civs start with it

Are modern city graphics going to be a thing?
* Automobile          - avoid? (need to plan city graphics)
* Electronics         - avoid? (need to plan city graphics)

Have other weird side effects i want to avoid:
* Guerilla Warfare    - REMOVE!
* Gunpowder           - REMOVE!

Keep these in the tech tree and make them close to their standard usage:
* Philosophy          - free tech
* Monotheism          - normal cathedral effect?
* Mysticism           - normal temple effect?
* Ceremonial burial   - normal temple effect?
* Theology            - cathedral bonus
* Fusion Power        - nuclear plants don't blow up

All civs should start with these:
* Trade               - allows to see trade goods
* Map Making          - allows map trading

Probably remove these to avoid the tooltips that pop up:
* Bridge Building     - avoid

Need to give these to some civ for barbarians:
* Industrialization   - Need to give to some civ for barbarians (also transforms cities)
* Mobile Warfare      - Need to give to some civ for barbarians

Remove these as improvements are not a thing:
* Construction        - REMOVE! (no plan for fortresses)
* Radio               - REMOVE! (no airbases)
* Railroad            - REMOVE! (no railroads)
* Refrigeration       - REMOVE!

The side effects of these are irrelevant (no ships in the game)
* Nuclear Power
* Navigation
* Seafaring

Finally:
* Invention           - doesn't matter, no goodie huts

# City Improvements

Reference: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php?title=Using_Improvements_and_Wonders

(NOTE: to remove city improvements/wonders, i am assigning them
to 'plu' (PLU) which remains orphaned from the tech tree)
