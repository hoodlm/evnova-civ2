This is the working repository of **EV Nova for Civ2**, an adaptation of the 2002 space
trader/combat game EV Nova as a Civilization II mod (scenario).

If you just want to play it, you are better off downloading the
[latest release from CivFanatics](https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/ev-nova-mge.32307/).

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can either raise an issue on this repository or post in the
[civfanatics discussion thread](https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/ev-nova-new-sci-fi-scenario-mge.698045/).

See "\_README.TXT" (the README that accompanies the scenario) for more details.
