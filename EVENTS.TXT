As the Krypt Pod attacked the ship's shields, it also assaulted the minds of the men and
women on the ship. Nothing in their military training specifically prepared them for what
you have now learned was a telepathic attack; but with their disciplined minds they
nonetheless prevailed. A group of xenobiologists, studying the crew of the ships, now
theorize that there is a latent telepathic ability in some subset of your population.

All attempts at communication with the Wraith have failed; and unfortunately all
encounters have been hostile. In spite of significant ethical considerations, a military
science team performed an unauthorized autopsy of a dead Wraith. The officer in charge of
that team has been disciplined, but what's done is done - the study of novel alien biology is,
after all, the most significant biological discovery in centuries. (Wraith Biology unlocked!)

As humanity has expanded into the Milky Way, there are some traces of a past civilization 
- what the xenohistorian community calls Those Who Came Before. But, the artifical ring 
constructed around this planet is the most intact example discovered so far. The structure is 
ancient, but far beyond the capabilities of even Polaris technology. Your physicists believe 
the ring may have been part of a transportation device, with the ability to travel orders
of magnitude further than hyperspace drives or hypergates. Perhaps even to another galaxy...
