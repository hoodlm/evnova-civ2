As the Krypt Pod attacked the ship's shields, it also assaulted the minds of the men and 
women on the ship. Nothing in their military training specifically prepared them for what 
you have now learned was a telepathic attack; but with their disciplined minds they 
nonetheless prevailed. A group of xenobiologists, studying the crew of the ships, now 
theorize that there is a latent telepathic ability in some subset of your population.

All attempts at communication with the Wraith have failed; and unfortunately all 
encounters have been hostile. In spite of significant ethical considerations, a military 
science team performed an unauthorized autopsy of a dead Wraith. The officer in charge of 
that team has been disciplined, but what's done is done - the study of novel alien biology is, 
after all, the most significant biological discovery in centuries. (Wraith Biology unlocked!)
