Tech tree rework objectives, in this order:

Structural:

* "prune" the tech tree to have fewer filler advances
* make the tech tree more interconnected, rather than independent "trees" for eco/engineering/etc.
* put all govts in critical path for research tree
* unlock advanced governments earlier

Thematic:

* give suitable sci-fi names to tech

Mechanics:

* assign appropriate weights/values/categories to tech

### Filler advances (don't allow any buildings/units)

* Capacitor Pulse Laser
* Engineering
* Fusion power
* Mathematics
* Philosophy
* Mysticism
* Sanitation
* Seafaring
* Shipbuilding Contracts
* Telepath Mart. Arts
* Telepath Awareness (by-design)
* Wraith Biology (by design)

major changes:

* removed Mathematics (Monarchy & Republic fill in this spot in the tech tree instead)
* removed Seafaring (Currency leads directly to the things Seafaring led to before)
* removed Sanitation (was a dead end, no impact)
* removed Engineering (Invention leads directly to these instead)
* removed telepath martial arts (Instead, telepath indoctrination leads directly to aur. energy weapons / thunderforge)
