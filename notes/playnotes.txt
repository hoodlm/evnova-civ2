As Aurorans:

Argosy is just a worse version of starbridge. should give it extra HP or something?
Forgot to block starting techs. Federation is building Wraith...
Pegasuses are too slow compared to other units.
Tech is too slow. Accelerate tech paradigm 2X?
Wraith/Krypt are building Pegasusus

As Rebels:

Game is just about alpha playable.
Something's off with the rebel tech tree, couldn't get more techs


As Aurorans:

Similar issue, Auroran techs aren't available

(issue is the 'once-removed/twice-removed' bug described here: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php?title=Advanced_Tech%27_Tree_Design_-_Part_One )

As Polaris:

tech tree seems fixed

Still need to disable negotiation/diplomacy with Wraith and Krypt
Make freighters (cambrian/leviathan) ignore ZoC
Federation got taken out by Aurorans. Maybe give civs City Walls in capital planets?
Assoc killed by Rebellion too
Barbarians (pirates) are actually pretty dangerous. I think this is a good thing!
In general the map is probably too empty. The AI barely seems to settle any cities, probably becaues it doesn't see any terrain that it thinks is suitable.
Pirate carrier might be too strong? at least needs to be more expensive
Pol Dragon probably needs a nerf
Increase paradrop range on zephyr
Map feels too "big" especially to get out to vellos space. maybe add some roads for the old hypergate network.
May even consider redoing the map as a medium map rather than a large map...

"Alpha v0.1"

As Federation
* Anaconda has a Range attribute
* A wraith immediately wrecked me...
* Got the krypt popup because the Wraith and the Krypt were fighting...


3e52716de4d72cb348b8c7fb3ad4e62d56fe0c62

"Alpha v0.2"

As Federation

* Made peace and started trading with Rebellion immediately (maybe should disable negotiation between Rebels/Fed?)
* Pirate Valk and Rebel Valk have the exact same stats but Pirate Valk costs 2x as much
* Similar issue with anaconda vs fed patrol boat
* Duplicate wraith/krypt pop-ups after the first event (need to make the event trigger only once)

As Assoc

* Pirate Valk is better than Pirate Starbridge?

In general: unit costs / tiers need to be realigned and intentionally balanced for alpha0.3
Also going to "spread out" the tech trees so that auroran cruisers and scarabs aren't flying around so early in the game.


Units with hidden shields that need to be fixed:

Pegasus
Sprite
Thunderforge
Starbridge
Javelin
Pirate Starbridge
Pirate Carrier
Pirate Valkyrie
Fed Destroyer
Fed Patrol boat
Rebel Dragon
Rebel Starbridge
Rebel Valkyrie
Manta
Scarab
Raven
Leviathan
Cambrian
Krypt Pod

As aurorans:
* BUG: Factory is still not buildable for some reason
* Balance: Abomination is too hard to research (you get Pir Starbridge must faster and with fewer techs). Needs a buff, maybe 3a/2d?
* BUG: Other civs can build Wraith. need a "human tech" or something to prevent alien units from being buildable by human civs.
* BUG: Shield on pirate carrier is still too far to the right (tears when the unit moves)
* Fun: Should adjust civs to be more hostile at beginning of the game
* Fun: Consider playtesting a SMALL map! or make less of the map able to be settled. too much open space as-is.
* Fun/Balance: Units are too "same-y" by end of the game. Pretty much no reason to use cruiser/destroyers when carriers are available.
  Consider making all carriers strong offense units? That lines up with the usage in the game, their role is to launch long range attacks
  and fighters, but require destroyer escorts. A couple loose gunships (a few abominations / patrol boats / dragon) should be able take out an
  unguarded carrier.
* BUG: What happens if there's global warming? maybe just turn off pollution, and get rid of the some of the pollution improvements
  (mass transit, recycling, etc.) to prune the tech tree a bit.
* BUG: rebel tech tree seems screwed up again
* FUN: Takes too long to move big warships to the front line. Maybe bring AIrport back (for airlifts) and call it Hypergate?
* FUN: If whoever discovers TWCB gets eliminated, it's impossible for anyone to get a sciecne victory. Maybe make TWCB a late-game researchable technology too?
* FUN: Rebels built a base way out in the middle of nowhere at the edges of the map. kind of frustrating when i can't build apollo program! definitely need a fix for that.


2025-05-03 - 786fd79cb55017b81aeca9dfa0f9b055c887a361

* starbridge has 4 movement, should have 3
* rebels immediately offer peace... maybe should just force feds/rebels to be at war?
* forgot to change personalities to be aggressive (e.g. on aurorans in particular)
* factory is too expensive

Techs with wrong artwork:
* Invention
* Electronics

* Tech tree still doesn't "feel" right. Needs a redesign, fewer techs, more linear and less branching tree. Too easy to go all-in on military too fast
* Hypergates are a bit too expensive compared to other buildings
* Overdid it on trade from most resource squares
* Wraith took over a bunch of Polaris cities...?
* since wraith tech is mobile warfare, it causes all your barracks to be obsolete... need to fix
* AI doesn't seem very good at navigating the tech tree in general; very easy to outpace them


2025-05-18 - 5aeb847b56b3f6c8bb57ee77bb585a6e86175150

bugs:
* Polaris are missing Hyperspace Engines as a starting tech
* GLi-Tech (Sun Tzu) is missing from the tech tree


2025-05-31 - fdf9d339805ba65fb7831d121106ffeb4db06cf6

as Polaris

* can't research tunneling organ (zephyr) for some reason. probably introduced a tech tree bug.
* the various leader titles ("CEO Kuron") are silly. should just fix titles for all govts for each civ maybe.
* AI governance (communism) nerfs holovids but you can avoid reseraching it since it's terminal. should stick it somewhere critical in the tech tree.


2025-06-05 - 0f9f15b904cba4f75eb0300caaa96e71f3e86977

As Assoc

* Pirate tech tree is pretty hard to ramp up as Assoc. Consider giving them some extra NONE pir starbridges at the start or something to balance?
* Graphics TODO: Roads, City wall visual indicator on cities
* Arcology isn't necessary because most city locations can't even scale up to 10. Make it size 6 maybe.
