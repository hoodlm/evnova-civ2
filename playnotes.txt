As Aurorans:

Argosy is just a worse version of starbridge. should give it extra HP or something?
Forgot to block starting techs. Federation is building Wraith...
Pegasuses are too slow compared to other units.
Tech is too slow. Accelerate tech paradigm 2X?
Wraith/Krypt are building Pegasusus

As Rebels:

Game is just about alpha playable.
Something's off with the rebel tech tree, couldn't get more techs


As Aurorans:

Similar issue, Auroran techs aren't available

(issue is the 'once-removed/twice-removed' bug described here: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php?title=Advanced_Tech%27_Tree_Design_-_Part_One )

As Polaris:

tech tree seems fixed

Still need to disable negotiation/diplomacy with Wraith and Krypt
Make freighters (cambrian/leviathan) ignore ZoC
Federation got taken out by Aurorans. Maybe give civs City Walls in capital planets?
Assoc killed by Rebellion too
Barbarians (pirates) are actually pretty dangerous. I think this is a good thing!
In general the map is probably too empty. The AI barely seems to settle any cities, probably becaues it doesn't see any terrain that it thinks is suitable.
Pirate carrier might be too strong? at least needs to be more expensive
Pol Dragon probably needs a nerf
Increase paradrop range on zephyr
Map feels too "big" especially to get out to vellos space. maybe add some roads for the old hypergate network.
May even consider redoing the map as a medium map rather than a large map...

"Alpha v0.1"

As Federation
* Anaconda has a Range attribute
* A wraith immediately wrecked me... maybe need to make the wraith unit types Defender
* Got the krypt popup because the Wraith and the Krypt were fighting...
