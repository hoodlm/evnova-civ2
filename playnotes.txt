As Aurorans:

Argosy is just a worse version of starbridge. should give it extra HP or something?
Forgot to block starting techs. Federation is building Wraith...
Pegasuses are too slow compared to other units.
Tech is too slow. Accelerate tech paradigm 2X?
Wraith/Krypt are building Pegasusus

As Rebels:

Game is just about alpha playable.
Something's off with the rebel tech tree, couldn't get more techs


As Aurorans:

Similar issue, Auroran techs aren't available

(issue is the 'once-removed/twice-removed' bug described here: https://sleague.civfanatics.com/index.php?title=Advanced_Tech%27_Tree_Design_-_Part_One )

As Polaris:

tech tree seems fixed

Still need to disable negotiation/diplomacy with Wraith and Krypt
Make freighters (cambrian/leviathan) ignore ZoC
Federation got taken out by Aurorans. Maybe give civs City Walls in capital planets?
Assoc killed by Rebellion too
Barbarians (pirates) are actually pretty dangerous. I think this is a good thing!
In general the map is probably too empty. The AI barely seems to settle any cities, probably becaues it doesn't see any terrain that it thinks is suitable.
Pirate carrier might be too strong? at least needs to be more expensive
Pol Dragon probably needs a nerf
Increase paradrop range on zephyr
Map feels too "big" especially to get out to vellos space. maybe add some roads for the old hypergate network.
May even consider redoing the map as a medium map rather than a large map...

"Alpha v0.1"

As Federation
* Anaconda has a Range attribute
* A wraith immediately wrecked me...
* Got the krypt popup because the Wraith and the Krypt were fighting...

"Alpha v0.2"

As Federation

* Made peace and started trading with Rebellion immediately (maybe should disable negotiation between Rebels/Fed?)
* Pirate Valk and Rebel Valk have the exact same stats but Pirate Valk costs 2x as much
* Similar issue with anaconda vs fed patrol boat
* Duplicate wraith/krypt pop-ups after the first event (need to make the event trigger only once)

As Assoc

* Pirate Valk is better than Pirate Starbridge?

In general: unit costs / tiers need to be realigned and intentionally balanced for alpha0.3
Also going to "spread out" the tech trees so that auroran cruisers and scarabs aren't flying around so early in the game.


Units with hidden shields that need to be fixed:

Pegasus
Sprite
Thunderforge
Starbridge
Javelin
Pirate Starbridge
Pirate Carrier
Pirate Valkyrie
Fed Destroyer
Fed Patrol boat
Rebel Dragon
Rebel Starbridge
Rebel Valkyrie
Manta
Scarab
Raven
Leviathan
Cambrian
Krypt Pod
