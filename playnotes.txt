As Aurorans:

Argosy is just a worse version of starbridge. should give it extra HP or something?
Forgot to block starting techs. Federation is building Wraith...
Pegasuses are too slow compared to other units.
Tech is too slow. Accelerate tech paradigm 2X?
Wraith/Krypt are building Pegasusus

As Rebels:

Game is just about alpha playable.
Something's off with the rebel tech tree, couldn't get more techs


As Aurorans:

Similar issue, Auroran techs aren't available
